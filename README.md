# Work In Progress - Not ready for use yet.

* There is a bug in the Omi3 utils plugin (in the [domain.ts](https://github.com/ouestlabs/omi3/blob/main/packages/utils/src/constants/domain.ts) file) that will cause the plugin to break. the fix is to remove the lines referencing environment variables or download from the repo and remove the domain.ts file and build the project.
